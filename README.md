## Project Overview:

The "Python Programming Exploration of Hepatitis in India from 2021-2023" project, developed by Dang Nguyen Quang Huy, is a comprehensive exploration utilizing various Python libraries for different purposes.

- The **Speech** section incorporates `pyttsx3` and `speech_recognition` for voice interactions and commands.

- For creating graphical user interfaces (GUI), the project utilizes the `tkinter` library along with `matplotlib` for data visualization.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using popular data science libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and machine learning tools from `sklearn`, including dimensionality reduction with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and feature selection.

- The project also includes a gaming component, leveraging the `pygame` library for game development.
